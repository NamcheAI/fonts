# Namche families (RoundCorner)

Production path: **Glyphs RoundCorner export filters** on Geist Sans upright sources.

Operational findings (CLI failure, naming collisions, verification): [`LEARNINGS.md`](../../LEARNINGS.md). Outside Glyphs / interactive app options: [`ROUNDCORNER_OUTSIDE_GLYPHS.md`](ROUNDCORNER_OUTSIDE_GLYPHS.md).

**Both families ship** in the local specimen (`PREVIEW_FAMILIES`) and under `~/Library/Fonts/Namche-Shadow{,-Simple}/`.

| Family | Status | Recipe | Paste file |
|--------|--------|--------|------------|
| **Namche-Shadow** | Shipping (primary) | Multi-tier stack (2026-08-11d) — see below | `roundcorner_shadow_filters.txt` |
| **Namche-Shadow-Simple** | Shipping | Mild `−25` exclude + strong `−40` include (caps/figures set) | `roundcorner_caps_figs_filters.txt` |

> Naming note (2026-08-11): multi-tier was briefly called **Namche-Darth**; that name is retired. The old two-radius (−40/−25) family is **Namche-Shadow-Simple**.

### Namche-Shadow static filter stack (order matters)

On every **static** instance (Thin → Black) — **2026-08-11d**:

1. `RoundCorner;-60;exclude:…` — base / rest
2. `RoundCorner;-80;include:…` — most caps / figures
3. `RoundCorner;-60;include:A, V, Z, X, Germandbls`
4. `RoundCorner;-50;include:k, x, v, w`
5. `RoundCorner;-40;include:M, N, W, two, four, seven, six`
6. `RoundCorner;-50;include:nine`

**Variable instance:** RoundCorner filters **off** (strip entirely). Glyphs reports incompatible masters when filters reshape contours for VF. Shipping Namche Shadow Sans is **statics only** — see [`documentation/NAMCHE_SHADOW_STATICS.md`](../documentation/NAMCHE_SHADOW_STATICS.md).

### Namche-Shadow-Simple

Two-radius pair on statics: `−25` exclude + `−40` include (caps/figures set). Same VF rule (filters off).

## Paths

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `../originals/geist/` | **Immutable** pristine Geist Sans upright sources |
| `../sources/NamcheShadowSans.glyphspackage` | Working Namche Shadow Sans upright package |
| `apply_roundcorner_filters.py` | Writes **two-radius** Filter pairs (`--strong` / `--mild`) — for **Shadow-Simple** |
| `inner_round_app.py` | Local static specimen — both families when OTFs exist |
| `../exports/Namche-Shadow/` | Primary Shadow delivery + `Namche-Shadow.glyphspackage` + `_received` |
| `../exports/Namche-Shadow-Simple/` | Simple (−40/−25) delivery + package + `_received` |

## Apply filters

```bash
cd .

# Shadow-Simple (two-radius helper)
python3 scripts/apply_roundcorner_filters.py --strong -40 --mild -25

# Shadow (multi-tier): Glyphs UI or paste scripts/roundcorner_shadow_filters.txt onto statics.
# Do not use the two-radius helper for the multi-tier stack.
```

**Never edit files under `originals/geist/`.**

## Export from Glyphs

1. Open the family package (`exports/Namche-Shadow/Namche-Shadow.glyphspackage` or Simple package / `sources/…`).
2. Confirm static RoundCorner filters; VF has none.
3. Export static OTFs (Thin → Black). Files may still be named `Geist-*.otf` — rename / fix name tables to **Namche-Shadow** or **Namche-Shadow-Simple** before delivery.
4. Optionally export the variable font **without** RoundCorner filters.
5. Build `woff` / `woff2` into the matching `exports/<Family>/` folder.

## Local specimen (static files)

```bash
cd .
python3 scripts/inner_round_app.py
# → http://127.0.0.1:8765
```

Serves fonts for families listed in `PREVIEW_FAMILIES` (Shadow + Shadow-Simple).

## Why Cursor / `glyphs-cli` RoundCorner export failed

Automated export from Cursor used [`glyphs-cli`](https://pypi.org/project/glyphs-cli/). That path **does not reliably apply Glyphs RoundCorner instance filters**, even when Filter custom parameters are present.

**Evidence (Regular `H`):**
| Export | `curveTo` count on `H` |
|--------|-------------------------|
| Glyphs GUI (known good) | **4** (inners rounded) |
| `glyphs-cli` (with/without native Filter string) | **0** (sharp) |

Prefer **File → Export… inside Glyphs.app**. Proof an inner-corner glyph (`H`, `E`, `a`) after any automated export.

### Manual drops

Archives live under each family’s `_received/` (formerly also under a `Namche-Darth/` folder name — that tree is now `exports/Namche-Shadow/`).

| Date | Archive | Notes |
|------|---------|--------|
| 2026-08-11d | `exports/Namche-Shadow/_received/2026-08-11d-*` | Current multi-tier (6 filters); Downloads `Namche-Shadow.glyphspackage` + `NamcheShadowSans-*.otf` |
| 2026-08-11c | `exports/Namche-Shadow/_received/2026-08-11c-*` | Prior GUI drop (5-filter era) |
| 2026-08-11b | `exports/Namche-Shadow/_received/2026-08-11b-multi-tier-gui-otf/` | Earlier multi-tier GUI OTFs |
| 2026-08-11 | `exports/Namche-Shadow/_received/2026-08-11-Geist.glyphspackage` | Early multi-tier source package |
| 2026-08-10 | `exports/Namche-Shadow-Simple/_received/2026-08-10-shadow-restored-from-manual/` | **Namche-Shadow-Simple** (−40/−25) restore source |

`Geist-*.otf` in Downloads may be either recipe depending on which package was exported — confirm before renaming into `exports/Namche-*/`.

## Future idea (not implemented)

Interactive radius sliders in the specimen would only swap pre-exported static packs (or rewrite plist + require Glyphs re-export). Browser cannot run Glyphs RoundCorner live.
