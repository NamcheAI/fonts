Namche Shadow is a three-family type suite based on
[Vercel's Geist](https://github.com/vercel/geist-font):

| Family | Source | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Namche Shadow Sans** | Geist Sans | Custom inner-corner treatment designed by Michael Marte |
| **Namche Shadow Mono** | Geist Mono | Identical outlines and metrics; renamed for future Namche-specific work |
| **Namche Shadow Pixel** | Geist Pixel | Identical outlines and metrics; renamed for future Namche-specific work |

The repository follows the upstream Geist font-project layout: buildable
sources are in `sources/`, generated releases are in `fonts/`, automation is
in `.github/workflows/`, and the Next.js package is in `packages/next/`.

## Building

Fonts are built and tested by GitHub Actions. To run the same workflow
locally:

```sh
make build
make test
make proof
```

The current Fontspector baseline and triage guidance are documented in
[`documentation/FONTSPECTOR.md`](documentation/FONTSPECTOR.md).

The Namche Shadow Sans RoundCorner workflow still requires Glyphs for final design
exports. See [`scripts/NAMCHE_SHADOW.md`](scripts/NAMCHE_SHADOW.md) and
[`LEARNINGS.md`](LEARNINGS.md) before producing a release.

## Repository layout

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `sources/` | Namche-named Glyphs sources and gftools builder configs |
| `fonts/` | OTF, TTF, and WOFF2 distributions; variable builds where release-ready |
| `originals/geist/` | Immutable safecopy of the original Geist sources |
| `scripts/` | Upstream build helpers and Namche Shadow Sans design tooling |
| `packages/next/` | Next.js package, adapted from the upstream package |
| `documentation/` | Specimens, proofs, and project history |

The original archive must not be edited. Its provenance is documented in
[`originals/geist/UPSTREAM.md`](originals/geist/UPSTREAM.md).

The npm release workflow is prepared for token-free OIDC publishing. Its
one-time registry bootstrap is documented in
[`documentation/TRUSTED_PUBLISHING.md`](documentation/TRUSTED_PUBLISHING.md).

### Static and variable fonts

Namche Shadow Sans currently ships only as static Thin through Black weights.
Those files are exported from Michael's multi-tier RoundCorner instances and
are served by the default, `font/sans`, and `font/sans-non-variable` npm
entry points. The Sans variable font is intentionally parked until the
rounded outlines have been made interpolation-compatible after rounding.

Namche Shadow Mono and Namche Shadow Pixel retain their upstream-derived
variable builds.

## Credits

The Namche Shadow Sans design direction and implementation is done by
[Michael Marte](https://github.com/fizzybubbele) for
[Ruhm etc.](https://ruhmetc.com/).

The suite is derived from Geist, created by Vercel in collaboration with
Basement Studio, Andrés Briganti, Mateo Zaragoza, and the other contributors
listed in [`AUTHORS.txt`](AUTHORS.txt) and [`CONTRIBUTORS.txt`](CONTRIBUTORS.txt).
Namche Shadow Mono and Namche Shadow Pixel currently preserve their upstream
outlines exactly; their new names do not imply an original redesign.

[SIL Open Font License 1.1](OFL.txt). Original Geist copyright notices and
author credits are retained in the sources and binary font metadata.
