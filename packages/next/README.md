# Namche Shadow Sans for Next.js

The package exposes Namche Shadow Sans, Namche Shadow Mono, and the five Namche
Shadow Pixel variants through `next/font/local`.

## Installation

```sh
pnpm add @namche/namche-shadow
```

## Usage

```tsx
import { NamcheShadowSans } from "@namche/namche-shadow/font/sans";
import { NamcheShadowMono } from "@namche/namche-shadow/font/mono";

export default function Layout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html className={`${NamcheShadowSans.variable} ${NamcheShadowMono.variable}`}>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

The primary Namche Shadow Sans export uses the customized static weights. A
metadata-renamed variable fallback is present in the downloadable font archive
for compatibility, but it still has upstream Geist outlines and is not used by
the recommended npm export. Mono remains a true variable-font export.

Pixel variants are exported from `@namche/namche-shadow/font/pixel`:

- `NamcheShadowPixelSquare`
- `NamcheShadowPixelGrid`
- `NamcheShadowPixelCircle`
- `NamcheShadowPixelTriangle`
- `NamcheShadowPixelLine`
