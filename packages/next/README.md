# Namche Shadow Sans for Next.js

The package exposes Namche Shadow Sans, Namche Shadow Mono, and the five Namche
Shadow Pixel variants through `next/font/local`.

## Installation

```sh
pnpm add @namche/namche-shadow
```

## Usage

```tsx
import { NamcheShadowSans } from "@namche/namche-shadow/font/sans";
import { NamcheShadowMono } from "@namche/namche-shadow/font/mono";

export default function Layout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html className={`${NamcheShadowSans.variable} ${NamcheShadowMono.variable}`}>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

The default export, `font/sans`, and `font/sans-non-variable` all use the
static upright and italic Namche Shadow Sans weights. The upright Thin through
Black files are Michael's multi-tier RoundCorner exports. The Sans variable
font is intentionally withheld until its rounded outlines are
interpolation-compatible. The Mono exports currently provide upright styles.

Pixel variants are exported from `@namche/namche-shadow/font/pixel`:

- `NamcheShadowPixelSquare`
- `NamcheShadowPixelGrid`
- `NamcheShadowPixelCircle`
- `NamcheShadowPixelTriangle`
- `NamcheShadowPixelLine`

The Namche Shadow Sans design direction and implementation is done by
[Michael Marte](https://github.com/fizzybubbele) for
[Ruhm etc.](https://ruhmetc.com/).
